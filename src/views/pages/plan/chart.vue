          <h3>3 routes</h3>
          <p>There is more than one way to enter a junior college, vocational school, undergraduate or graduate school in Japan. Broadly speaking, there are three routes.
              Method A: After studying Japanese at a Japanese language school in Japan, enter a university or vocational school. Method B: Come to Japan,
              take an entrance exam for a university or vocational school, and
              enter after passing the
              exam. Also, study abroad period and fees are different. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Below is a summary of the pros and cons of each method. Please think about which study abroad plan is reasonable for you.

          <h3>Method A</h3>
          <p>In Method A, you first come to Japan with permission to enter a Japanese language school, study Japanese at a Japanese language school in Japan, and then take entrance exams for universities and vocational schools.
              The advantages of this method are: <br>
              ○ You don't have to spend much time studying Japanese in your home country<br>
              ○ By spending six months to two years studying Japanese, you can solidify your Japanese language skills, which will be the basis for studying in Japan ○You can get used to life in Japan during the period of Japanese language learning <br>
              ● It takes longer to graduate from university after coming to Japan, and the total cost of studying abroad, including tuition and living expenses, increases. <br>
              ● The maximum period for studying Japanese is two years, so if you do not pass any university or vocational school during the two years, you will have to return to your home country .

          <h3>Method B</h3>
          <p>In the B method, first, obtain information about the school you want to go to in your home country, apply for it, and have the examination slip sent to you. Students will come to Japan on the day of the exam and take entrance exams for universities and vocational schools. Once you return to your home country and wait for the results of your application, you can come back to Japan and enter the school if you pass. Method B has the following advantages. <br>
              ○ Since the period from arrival to Japan to graduation is shorter than in Method A, the total cost of studying abroad is lower than in Method A. <br>
              ○ If you fail the entrance examination, you can wait for the next chance in your home country, so there is less time and cost burden . <br>
              ● It is necessary to acquire sufficient Japanese proficiency (or English, depending on the school) in your home country. <br>
              ● If you cannot apply directly from your home country, you must apply through friends, acquaintances, or relatives in Japan . If you do not make a round trip, your stay in Japan will be longer, and the cost of your stay will increase accordingly.

          <h3>Method C Pre-Arrival Admission</h3>
          <p>Some junior colleges, universities, and graduate schools grant admission based on the results of the EJU if you have taken the EJU overseas. However, there is currently no EJU in China.
              In addition, there are some schools that conduct entrance examinations overseas and issue admission without taking the Examination for Japanese University Admission for International Students, or examine only documents sent from overseas.
              This selection method is called “pre-arrival admission permission”.
              Some universities do not require Japanese proficiency for admission, and offer English courses that allow students to graduate from classes taught only in English. In many cases, you can take the English course without coming to Japan. Below is a list of English courses.

              The advantages of Study Abroad Method C are as follows. <br>

              ○ Unlike Method B, you do not need to come to Japan to take an exam, so the burden of time and costs is less than Method B. <br>
              ○ You can start your specialized studies immediately after arriving in Japan. <br>
              ● It is necessary to acquire sufficient Japanese proficiency (or English proficiency depending on the school) in your home country. <br>
              ● There are few schools that offer pre-arrival admission . <br>

        <p>During the cold winter time, the risk of fires becomes higher. There are two possible reasons; one is the dry air which makes things flammable, the other is the frequent use of the heating apparatus. However, these aren't the only causes of fire. In most cases, fires are caused by the careless housekeeping practices such as cooking stove, carelessness in extinguishing the cigarettes, outlets covered with dust, too much electrical cords bound together or leaving a lamp left on near the curtain etc.</p>

Cover your mouth and nose with a wet towel, drop to the floor and crawl on your knees so that you don't breathe the smoke, and try getting outdoors. In addition, when evacuating, close the door and windows of the room with fire and shut the air, so that the fire doesn't get stronger and also prevent the fire to spread.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, it is required to check how to evacuate in case of a fire; the location of the emergency stairs and emergency ladders; if there is a balcony, check whether you can move to the neighbor's one easily, and don't put any object that could be an obstacle in case of emergency; whether there are no obstacles in the stairs or the corridors of the apartment or flat. Try to have good maintenance of the exit ways.</p>

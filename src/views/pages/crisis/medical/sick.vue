          <br>
          * Medical Institutions equipped with more than 20 beds are called "hospitals (byouin)", those with less than 19 beds are called "clinic (sinnryoujo, clinic, or iin in Japanese)".</p>

        <div class="lifeH5 padT15"><h5>Amenity Bed (Pay Bed)</h5></div>
        <p class="padT15">Usually each rooms in the hospital is quite large such as for six people. If going into a smaller room or a private room, you'll be asked for additional charges. This is called the amenity bed cost. This can't be covered by insurance, not even part of it, and will be the patient's pay. In addition, the cost of amenity bed differs from hospital to hospital.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the vacancies of the hospital, it's possible that there is only vacancy in the room which requires an amenity bed cost. Even though the rule says that hospitals can't collect the amenity bed cost without the agreement of the patient, please be careful when signing an agreement or application form. Please beware of the cost and sign it only after being satisfied about the content.</p>

        <p>You could become a criminal if you pick up an unattended bicycle from the dump, which looks of use, to your home. It's no worth asking: "What is bad about picking up something in the dump?"<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes, you could violate a law without knowing you are. Your behavior could lead to an unexpected result. Once breaking the law, there is no room left for excuse by saying that you didn't know.</p>

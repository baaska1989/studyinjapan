        <p>At the time of a disaster such as an earthquake and on evacuation, what counts most is to obtain accurate information. Information concerning what the damage situation is, where to take refuge, and what is available at evacuation areas and shelters. Even Japanese people, who are used to and get prepared for earthquakes have difficulty getting solid information, and taking proper action with them. In foreigners' case, it is highly possible to fall behind people on evacuation, or to fail to get assisting service at evacuation areas when he is not sufficiently proficient in Japanese or does not get accustomed to the life in Japan. Besides, it is anticipated that you foreigners would be under a lot of stress if you are in stuck among people whom you cannot communicate easily. Furthermore, it must be more fear and uneasiness than could be imagined if you lack in basic knowledge of disasters.<br>
          <br>
          Then, how can we assist foreign resident who are in need of help?</p>

        <div class="lifeH4 padT15"><h4><a id="1">Volunteer Interpreter</a></h4></div>
        <p class="padT15">Local autonomous bodies and the international associations organize "Volunteer Interpreter" with the aim of assisting foreigners who have difficulty communicating in Japanese during large-scale disasters including earthquakes. Volunteer interpreters will be engaged in the activities such as:</p>
        <ul class="padL15 padB5 padT5">
          <li>1-1. Interpretation for foreign sufferers at evacuation shelters or hospitals.</li>
          <li>1-2. Interpretation and translation at disaster headquarters or disaster information centers.</li>
          <li>1-3. To provide foreigners with information about prevention measures, evacuation, and lifeline, e.g. at advisory service desk.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="lifeH4"><h4><a id="2">You can contribute as a volunteer interpreter</a></h4></div>

        <p class="padT15">Volunteer interpreters don't consist only of Japanese people who are proficient in languages. Among foreigners who live in Japan, there are students, businessmen, and language teachers who can speak fluent Japanese. Not only they speak both native language and Japanese, but they are versed in their own culture and custom so that they can well understand the situations and feelings of the foreign sufferers. In that point, it is likely that foreign volunteers can help victims of a disaster more than Japanese volunteers can. Please give it consideration that you as a foreigner would contribute to assisting foreign sufferers during a disaster.</p>
